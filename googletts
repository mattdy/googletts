# Some inspiration taken from http://danfountain.com/2013/03/raspberry-pi-text-to-speech/

# Version 1.2 (08/08/15)
# Changes:
#  - Use urllib to properly encode variables (thanks to Paul for the fix!)

# Process some text input from our arguments, and then pass them to the Google translate engine
# for Text-To-Speech translation in nicely formatted chunks (the API cannot handle more than 100
# characters at a time).
# Splitting is done first by any punctuation (.,;:) and then by splitting by the MAX_LEN defined
# below.
# mpg123 is required for playing the resultant MP3 file that is returned by Google TTS
